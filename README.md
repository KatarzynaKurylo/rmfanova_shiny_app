# rmfanova_shiny_app
In collaboration with Professor UAM ≈Åukasz Smaga we created a package in R:
[Repeated Measures Functional Analysis of Variance package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmfanova/index.html).
Please read [Repeated Measures Functional Analysis of Variance article](https://sit.stat.gov.pl/SiT/2024/2/gus_sit_2024_02_katarzyna_kurylo_lukasz_smaga_functional_repeated_measures_analysis.pdf) to learn more about this topic. 

We created shiny app to make rmfanova easier to use. The app is hosted on [Rmfanova_web_app website](https://katarzynakurylo.shinyapps.io/Rmfanova_web_app/).You can run it with the example csv file which we created based on DTI patients from [refund package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=refund). 

Feel free to ask questions.
